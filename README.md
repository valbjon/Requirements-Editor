    <dt><h4>What are the characteristics of a good, well written requirement?</h4></dt>
    <dd>A well written requirement sentence should be complete, correct, necessary, unambiguous, prioritized and verifiable.
        A good requirement should also avoid use of vague and general terms such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Redundant words: the system <b>must must</b> create….</li>
            <li>Superlatives: best, most...</li>
            <li>Subjective terms: user friendly, cost effective, esay to use...</li>
            <li>Vague pronouns: it, this, that...</li>
            <li>Ambiguous words: almost always, significant, minimal...</li>
            <li>Open ended and non-verifyable terms: provide support, but not limited to...</li>
            <li>Loopholes: if possible, if appropriate, if applicable...</li>
            <li>Negative statement: the system <b>must not</b> …. </li>

      <h4>What is a Requirement Template?</h4>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Requirement template is nothing more than a simple frame that gives structure and clarity to a requirement.
        Although there is no fixed standard template format to create a requirement, every requirement template share a set of structural components
        which define a set of constructs such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Actor/Owner such as people, system</li>
            <li>Action (Activity, task) such as read, write</li>
            <li>Object (Input, Output objects) such as message, information carrier (if exists)</li>
            <li>Condition (if exists)</li>
            <li>Constraint (if exists)</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dd>
        <b>Example:</b> "If two or more requirements are identical in the system, the requirement generator will
        send an error message unless the requirements are for different projects."
        <ul>
            <li>Condition - <i>If two or more requirements are identical</i> </li>
            <li>Actor/Owner - <i>The system</i></li>
            <li>Action - <i>Send</i> </li>
            <li>Object - <i>Error message</i></li>
            <li>Constraint - <i>Unless they are for different projects</i></li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
